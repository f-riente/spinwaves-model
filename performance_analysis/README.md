# Perfomance analysis

This folder contains all the scripts for RCA (ripple-carry adder) perfomance analysis.
If you are an user of these codes, you should touch only "User_interface.m", which is the user interface script. If you are a programmer, you can read the following description to change codes.


## Circuits
This folder contains the modelled RCA, and the implementation does not depend on the technology.


## CMOS_45nm
This folder contains the script to compute the perfomances of the FA using CMOS 45nm technology.


## YIG 
This folder contains the FA implementation using YIG technologies (100nm and 30nm).


## Other_files
This folder contains a script, performance_graphs.m. It could be useful to plot the perfomance comparison graphs.
