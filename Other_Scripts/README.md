This folder collects some useful scripts.


## chapter1_codes
The folder contains the scripts used to plot the chapter 1 graphs of the thesis.


## amplitude_calculation.m
It is script used to find the SW amplitude. The used equations are described in pag32-33 of the thesis.


## width_regulation.m
The script is useful to realize the phase shifter and delay line. The theoretical description is reported in pag 27-28 of the thesis.


## regenerators_design.m
This script can be used to find the DC coupled length (length of the coupled region) of the regenerators. 
To run the script, you need to complete "setting section" at the beginning of the script. If you move this script to another folder, you must change the line 34 (addpath...) of the code according to the comment. The algorithm description is reported in pag 77-78 of the thesis.






### Coupled_dispersioncurve_FM_effictivewidth.m and Single_dispersioncurve.m are provided by University of Vienna.
Single_dispersioncurve.m can be used to calculated the group velocity and the decay length x_freepath.
